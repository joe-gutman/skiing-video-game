# Game Goals and Definition
## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to create a complete game of decent quality that I enjoy playing. This involves designing a game that is engaging, fun, and provides a satisfying experience from start to finish.

## Definition of a Complete Game
A complete game, in the context of this project, is one that includes a full gameplay loop. This means the game should allow players to:
- Start the game with clear objectives.
- Engage in the core gameplay mechanics (e.g., skiing down slopes, avoiding obstacles).
- Reach a conclusion or end state (e.g., completing a course, achieving a score).
- Receive feedback or rewards based on their performance (e.g., score display, level completion).

In essence, a complete game should be playable from start to finish without requiring additional content or features to be considered finished.

## Quality and Enjoyment
The game should be of decent quality and enjoyable to play. This means it should:
- Be free of major bugs or issues that prevent players from enjoying the game.
- Have intuitive and simple interface and controls.
- Feature visually pleasing graphics that are cohesive and enhance the gameplay experience.
- Have satisfying and responsive controls that make playing enjoyable and tricks easy.
- Run smoothly without significant performance issues.

## Core Gameplay Loop
The core gameplay loop is the central mechanic that keeps players engaged. For this game, it might involve:
- Starting a new endless run.
- Skiing down the slope while
  - Avoiding obstacles
  - Collecting coins
  - Performing tricks on jumps, rails, over buildings, etc.
- Ending a run by crashing or dying in some way.
- Receiving a score or reward.

This loop should be enjoyable, challenging, and rewarding enough to keep players interested in playing again.
